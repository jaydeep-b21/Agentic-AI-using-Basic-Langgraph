i dont even know where to start, maybe from the beggining but even that feel all mixed up in my head. sometimes i feel like im still that small kid sittin on the stairs, watchin the rain and wonderin why everything feel so heavy even when nothing bad happen yet. it's like the world always been too big for me, too loud, too many things going on and i just wanted quiet.

growing up wasnt easy, but i guess it wasnt the worst either. my parents, they tried, i think. they did what they could. dad was always tired from work and mom was always trying to make everythin perfect but it never really was. we didnt talk about feelings, that was not a thing. if u cry, go to your room. if ur angry, be quiet. smile in front of people and act normal. but inside i wasnt normal. i didnt feel normal.

school was weird too. i was never the smart one or the cool one or the funny one. just there. just existin. people talk about dreams and futures and college but i couldnt even think about tomorrow. i just wanted to not feel like i was drownin in my own brain. teachers say i had potential but potential dont mean nothin if u dont know what to do with it.

sometimes i tried to write stuff down, like poems or stories or just rants. it felt like the only time i could actually breathe was when i write. but i always delete it later. like who cares what i think anyway? who even gonna read it? its just words and im just a nobody. i feel invisible most the time, unless im messin up. then suddenly everyone sees me.

theres a time when i thought i could be somethin. maybe a artist or a photographer or someone who tells stories. but then life keep getting in the way. bills, work, drama, all the boring real life stuff that kill dreams. i ended up workin at a place i hate, wakin up every morning just feelin numb. like im just goin through the motion. i see people around me laughin and smilin and i wonder if they really happy or just better at pretendin than me.

family still act like everything fine. "just work hard and it'll be okay," they say. but it dont feel okay. its like im runnin on a treadmill, movin but goin nowhere. and the more i try to talk about it, the more people say "its just a phase" or "everyone feel that way sometimes." but its not sometimes. its always. its every damn day.

i lost friends too. people grow up, move on. some got married, some got kids. i cant even commit to a plant. i try not to be jealous but sometimes i am. not cuz i want what they have, but cuz i wish i knew what it felt like to be sure of anything. like they got a map and im just wanderin in the dark with no flashlight.

love? dont even get me started. i think i felt it once. maybe twice. but i always ruin it. or maybe i never really had it. maybe i just wanted it so bad i pretended it was real. people say love is patient and kind but most the time it feel like love is just hard. its about sacrificin yourself just to keep someone who dont even see you. and when they leave, you left with even less of yourself than before.

i think about quittin sometimes. not like dying but just stoppin. like disappearin. packin up and goin somewhere no one know me. start fresh. be a new person. but would i really change? or would i just bring all the same broken pieces with me?

but even with all that, theres still a part of me, small but there, that think maybe theres still somethin left. like maybe this mess of a life still got some beauty in it. like the way the sun look at 6am when no one's awake. or the sound of laughin when its real. or the feelin when someone actually listen and not just wait for they turn to talk.

i dont got the answers. i dont even got the questions right most the time. but i keep wakin up. i keep goin to work. i keep writin even if no one reads it. maybe that mean somethin. maybe not. but its all i got right now.

and maybe someday, someone read this and feel less alone. or maybe they dont. but i wrote it anyway. cuz sometimes, thats all we can do.

just keep goin.
